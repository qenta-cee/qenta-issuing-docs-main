<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="generalOverview"><a class="anchor" href="#generalOverview"></a>General Overview</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Card in our system represents the cardholder&#8217;s physical or virtual card. These cards utilize funds provided by the linked Balance Account. It&#8217;s important to note that multiple Card resources can be created per Balance Account.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the onboarding process for new clients, the organization must first onboard and upload information about its beneficial owner and control person, as described in the <a href="../cardholder-onboarding-process/" class="page">previous sections</a>. This prerequisite ensures that necessary background checks and verifications are completed before cardholders, cards, and associated balance accounts can be created.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This structured approach helps maintain regulatory compliance and ensures that all necessary parties and accounts are properly established before card issuance. If you have any questions or need assistance with card management processes, our team is available to provide guidance and support. We&#8217;re committed to facilitating a smooth and compliant card management experience for your organization.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="createCards"><a class="anchor" href="#createCards"></a>Create Cards</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For detailed technical information, please refer to the “Create card” <a href="https://swagger.qenta.com/baas/#tag/Card/operation/createCard">API documentation</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cards are issued based on the associated Legal Entity of the cardholder applicant. The residential address country of the cardholder applicant will determine the available card products. The legal entity&#8217;s official name will determine the card name displayed on the card.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These cards can be physical and/or virtual. Virtual cards have the option to be converted to physical cards at a later stage through the <a href="#convertCards">Convert Cards</a> process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upon creation, newly issued cards will have a status of NEW, which will automatically transition to ORDERED. This process triggers two events:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>card.created (card = NEW)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>card.updated (card = ORDERED)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a manual activation flow is configured, the card must be activated (through the <a href="#activateCards">Activate Cards</a> process) before it can be used for payments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This structured approach ensures that cards are issued accurately and in alignment with regulatory requirements, providing a frictionless experience for cardholders. Should you have any questions or need assistance with card creation processes, our team is available to provide support and guidance. We&#8217;re dedicated to facilitating a smooth and efficient card issuance process for your organization.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="cardDeliveryAddress"><a class="anchor" href="#cardDeliveryAddress"></a>Card Delivery Address</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In accordance with the card program, a cardholder (legal entity) may have either a physical or virtual card associated with their account. Physical cards require a delivery address linked to the cardholder, whereas virtual cards do not need a delivery address.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In scenarios where no address is provided for a physical card, the residential address specified in the Legal Entity resource is utilized.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s important to understand that verifying the individual&#8217;s residential address through the Know Your Customer (KYC) process is essential for card delivery. The delivery address must either align with the residential address or be left empty. In cases where it&#8217;s null, the default residential address of the legal entity will be used as a fallback.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This rigorous approach enhances security and compliance with regulatory standards, safeguarding the integrity of the card issuance process. If you have any inquiries or require assistance with card delivery procedures, our team is available to provide support and guidance. We&#8217;re committed to facilitating a seamless and compliant card delivery experience for your organization.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="embossedName"><a class="anchor" href="#embossedName"></a>Embossed Name</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The name embossed on the card originates from the name submitted by the cardholder applicant or from the name on the submitted ID document. However, you have the option to override this default behavior by specifying the embossedCardHolderName attribute of the card.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For cards featuring multi-line embossed names, '\n' serves as the line separator.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that the embossed name is considered a protected detail of the card and therefore will not be returned by the cards API. However, it is accessible through the Card Image Visualization <a href="#cardImageVisualization">API documentation</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This approach ensures that the embossed name accurately reflects the cardholder&#8217;s information while maintaining confidentiality and security. Should you have any questions or require further information regarding embossed names on cards, our team is available to assist you. We&#8217;re committed to ensuring a seamless and personalized card issuance process for your organization.</p>

<h2 id="activateCards"><a class="anchor" href="#activateCards"></a>Activate Cards</h2>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>For detailed technical information, please refer to the “Activate a card” <a href="https://swagger.qenta.com/baas/#tag/Card/operation/activateCard">API documentation</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are several available activation flows for cards:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Active after creation:</strong> Cards are automatically activated upon creation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manual activation with no additional validation parameters:</strong> Cards are activated manually without requiring additional validation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manual activation with CVV validation:</strong> Cards require manual activation, with the additional step of validating the CVV.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manual activation with last four digits validation:</strong> Cards require manual activation, with the additional step of validating the last four digits of the PAN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manual activation with access code validation:</strong> Cards require manual activation, with the additional step of validating the account holder’s access code</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Please consult with your implementation manager to configure the appropriate card activation flow based on your specific requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upon activation, a card.updated event is triggered to indicate the change in status.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This flexibility in activation flows allows you to tailor the card activation process to best suit your organization&#8217;s needs and security preferences. If you have any questions or need assistance with configuring the card activation flow, our team is available to provide guidance and support. We&#8217;re dedicated to ensuring a smooth and secure card activation process for your organization.</p>

<h3 id="lostStolen"><a class="anchor" href="#lostStolen"></a>Lost / Stolen</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a card is canceled due to loss or theft, a new card of the same type (physical or virtual) can be automatically generated and requested. By default, when cards are canceled for this reason, a replacement card is automatically ordered; however, this setting can be adjusted in the API or the Qenta Portal if a replacement is unnecessary.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the new card is physical, it will be delivered to the same address as the previous card. You will receive details about the new card through a card-created event. The new card can be linked to the old one through the previousCardId attribute.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The process triggers the following events:</p>

<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The cardholder initiates the process to view the card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You authenticate the cardholder (e.g., through fingerprint).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You initiate the call from your backend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The data is fetched on the cardholder&#8217;s device and combined with the card image.</p>
</li>
</ol>
