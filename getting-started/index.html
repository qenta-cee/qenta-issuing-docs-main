<p>Your designated Qenta contact will assist you in defining the card program tailored to your specific use cases. To create your program, we&#8217;ll require the following information:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Basic Information About You and Your Customers:</p>
<div class="ulist">

<p>Providing these details will enable us to craft a card program perfectly suited to your requirements. Feel free to discuss any additional considerations or questions with your Qenta contact. We&#8217;re committed to ensuring your embedded finance solution aligns seamlessly with your business objectives.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="AccountStructure"><a class="anchor" href="#AccountStructure"></a>Account Structure and Synchronization</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When creating a new program, a defined bank account structure must be represented within the Qenta Embedded Finance Platform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, our platform offers a simple setup, where one account holder corresponds to one balance account, with one associated card (1:1:1). However, based on your specific requirements, we also offer enhanced setups allowing for multiple account holders, balance accounts, and cards (n:n:n).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Should you require a custom setup, our team will collaborate with yours to determine the necessary steps for reserving and settling funds.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="/_images/issuing/resources_overview.png" alt="Image">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The outcome will be the establishment of account mapping and the seamless flow of funds, ensuring a streamlined and efficient process aligned with your program&#8217;s objectives. Should you have any questions or require further clarification, please don&#8217;t hesitate to reach out to us. We&#8217;re here to facilitate a smooth implementation process for you.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="Cards"><a class="anchor" href="#Cards"></a>The Card Type</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the account structure is established, we can proceed to define the type of card to be issued.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Card types are influenced by key program features such as deciding if physical or virtual cards will be issued, the country of issuance, and deciding on the individual card functions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Physical cards are tangible products produced and shipped to the cardholder. They can be used for various purposes including e-commerce transactions, payment terminals, card present, point-of-sale transactions, and ATM withdrawals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Virtual cards, on the other hand, are digital products without a physical form. They are displayed within your application to the cardholder and are primarily utilized for e-commerce, card-not-present transactions. Additionally, we offer the flexibility to convert virtual cards into physical cards if required by your program.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For further details, please refer to the <a href="../card-management/" class="page">Card Management</a> section.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your designated Qenta contact will assist you in determining the visual design and parameters of the card. Working closely with our key partners such as Mastercard, Visa, and our partner banking network, we ensure that your card design and associated marketing materials adhere to essential regulatory and marketing requirements. We&#8217;re here to support you throughout this process, ensuring a seamless and compliant card issuance experience.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Navigating the EU approval process for embedded finance can appear daunting, but with Qenta as your trusted partner, we&#8217;re dedicated to simplifying the journey. Here&#8217;s a comprehensive overview of the support we provide:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>New Client Questionnaire and Consultation:</strong> to kick off the process, our implementation team will provide you with a comprehensive new client questionnaire. Our team will guide you through the completion process, ensuring all necessary information is provided.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the questionnaire has been finalized, a consultation session can be scheduled. During this discussion, we&#8217;ll review key aspects such as fund flows, legal entity structures, and BIN requirements. Our objective is to gain a thorough understanding of your business needs and requirements. Together, we&#8217;ll work towards aligning these with the requirements for approval from our BIN sponsor, TPL.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Partner Initiation:</strong> Once all the required details are discussed and received, our team will initiate the project with our BIN sponsor and processing partner. This collaborative effort is necessary for setting the stage for a smooth implementation process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ll work together on technical setup tasks, including configuring the KYC/KYB flow, transaction rule suite, assigning BINs, and establishing transaction limits. These steps are important to ensure seamless integration and operational readiness. Throughout this process, our team will maintain clear communication and provide support to address any technical queries or challenges that may arise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Marketing and Legal Review:</strong> As we progress, ensuring that your marketing and legal materials comply with regulatory standards is essential. Our team will conduct a thorough review of these materials in collaboration with you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Together, we&#8217;ll assess your marketing collateral, website content, and legal documentation to ensure they meet industry regulations. Additionally, we&#8217;ll work closely on card design to ensure it aligns with your brand identity and regulatory requirements.</p>
